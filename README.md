What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a representation of a solution to a problem. If a problem can be defined as a difference between a desired situation and the current situation in which one is, then a problem solution is a procedure, or method, for transforming the current situation to the desired one. 

We solve many trivial problems every day without even thinking about it, for example making breakfast, travelling to the workplace etc. But the solution to such problems requires little effort and is relatively unimportant. However, the solution of a more interesting problem of more importance usually involves stating the problem in an understandable form and communicating the solution to others.

A computer has immense potential for saving time/energy. However, for a computer to perform a desired task, a method for carrying out some sequence of events, resulting in accomplishment of the task, must somehow be described to the computer. The algorithm can be described on many levels because the algorithm is just the procedure of steps to take and get the result. The language used to describe an algorithm to other people will be quite different from that which is actually used by the computer. Algorithms are written generically and can be translated into many programming languages.

An example of an algorithm people commonly use would be a recipe to make a cake.

1.	Heat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit
2.	Gather the ingredients
3.	Mix ingredients thoroughly in the bowl
4.	Pour mixture into the baking pan
5.	Bake for 50 minutes
6.	Remove it from oven
7.	Cool on the rack before serving.

In the problem-solving phase of computer programming, you will be designing algorithms. This means that you will have to be conscious of the strategies you use to solve problems in order to apply them to programming problems. 

There are two main methods of representing algorithms in the programming domain.

1.	Flowcharts 

2.	Pseudo code 
What is a Pseudo code?


Pseudocode is one of the tools that can be used to write a preliminary plan that can be developed into a computer program. Pseudocode is a generic way of describing an algorithm without the use of any specific programming language syntax. In fact, it serves as an English like way to state an algorithm. 

Pseudocode cannot be executed on a real computer, but it models and resembles real programming code, and is written at roughly the same level of detail.

Computer science textbooks often use pseudocode in their examples so that all programmers can understand them, even if they do not all know the same programming languages. Since pseudocode style varies from author to author, therefore following guidelines can be considered to ensure standardization: 

1. Pseudocode should be universal.
2. Make sure you put only one task on each line.
3. Capitalize keywords.
4. Indent statements to better represent flow of your program

Consider the following pseudocode example to get a better understanding on how they can be written:

Example: The following pseudo-code describes an algorithm which will accept two numbers from the keyboard and calculate the sum and product displaying the answer on the monitor screen.
Sample Pseudocode:



BEGIN
DISPLAY “Input two numbers”
ACCEPT number1, number2
sum = number1 + number2
PRINT “The sum is “, sum
product = number1 * number2
PRINT “The Product is “, product

END
